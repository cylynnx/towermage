BULLETIN GOTHIC is a digital revivalb of DAILY NEWS GOTHIC, a typeface designed by Gerry Powell for the New York Daily News newspaper. Currently, this digitization is all capital letters and without numerals. The glyphs it includes are traced directly from a 1939 trial proof of the typeface, which did not include all glyphs it originally contained. If all goes well, this typeface will be updated in the future to include numerals and other gylphs that are currently not available as well as to adjust kerning and leading issues.
